# Internship-Project
Project based on ML

A bank consists of a datafile 'Bank_Loan.csv' which has data of 5000 customers. This bank has a growing customer base and wants to increase its borrowers (asset customers) base to bring in more loan business and earn more through the interest on loans. A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed that only 480 out of 5000 customers (i.e.9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them. The bank wants to convert the liability based customers to personal loan customers while retaining them as depositors.

The goal of the department is to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan which will eventually increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.

The above mentioned datafile includes customer demographic information (age, income etc), customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer's response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).
